# DESCRIPTION
The okta_aws_login tool, written in Python 3, was developed to help solve the issue of needing to generate and store long lived AWS Access and Secret Keys on systems to be able to utilize AWS's CLI tools.

Okta is a leading Identity Provider and is often used by orginizations to federate user credntials and provide Single Sign On access to the AWS console. While using Okta resolves the issue of providing federated access to the AWS console it does not provide an "out-of-the-box" solution for federated access when using AWS's CLI tools.

The okta_aws_login tool will prompt the user for the necissary credentials needed to authenticate with the Okta IdP and
then utilize the SAML assertion generation by Okta to retrieve temporary AWS Access and Secret Keys and an AWS Session Token. The AWS credentials will then be written to the local AWS credentials file to be utilized by aws cli.
